# AVES-AUTOMATIC-VEHICLE-ENTRY-SYSTEM-
#### Video Demo:  < https://youtu.be/gsBzScDTuR8 >
Hello Humans,
The reason behind creating this application is that today many of us move to offices, malls, society, etcetera, and before entry, they need to form information entered manually, and typically people forgot to do data entry then they get marked absent in offices. To avoid this drawback I have created this application in order that once any vehicle enter's the office building it'll scan the automobile registration number plate and his entry can be done automatically.
I'm telling you some tips which are helps to run this project in your system:
1. Create some folders like: Capture_image, Cropped_image 
2. Change paths according to your system
3. Run On Visual Studio Code
4. Check SCREENSHOTS for better understanding
5. Create Database AVES and create 2 tables : MASTERTABLE, TRANSACTIONTABLE
6. Install some libraries like: OPENCV, MATPLOTLIB, PYQT5, PYTESSARCT, MYSQL CONNECTOR, NUMPY, IMUTILS, etc.
Now Enjoy!!
